the reviews were good, but sometimes hard to understand. some words you used i think were just the opposite of what you wanted to say (e.g. "The plot is deforming it, so it is easy to find out the density", where i think you mean the plot is a honest representation of the data but you are conveying the opposite)
i have a Chinese physics student who found some great resources on English scientific writing for Chinese speakers (which i assume you are). if you are interested i can forward it to you, just let me know

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
==================
[!alt text](hw8.png)

the default 3 datapoints for scatter plot should be changes as it is unnecessarily redundant

the color difference between white and asian is not visible and nearly all colors blend for color blind people


the thick-dashed line is not labeled nor in the legend.

the choice of thick and thick-dashed line and of 2 dotted lines in subdued colors seems to suggest the first two lines are the important ones, 
while the other ones are less important. 

tick labels are too small. axis labels are good and readable

the title is excessively large, taking attention away from the plot.

=====

the use if size nicely displays the third variable. 
the size range for the datapoints is sensible: nice differential, not too large points not too small points

axis labels and tick labels, and legend  are nicely readable



"ln, person" is not clear what it means: just say "population (natural log - and are you sure it is not log10!!! 
in log 10 the orders of magnitude are displayed at regular intervals. usually we plot in log10: 
it is easy to relate 3 in log10 to 10^3=1000 but in ln?)"

=======

small tick labels

small axis label (not terribly small but a bit)

the faint colors may not render well in a page with other stuff in it. 

assigning shades of red and blue to females and males does enhance clarity through intuition but it charges the plot with gender issues: more neutral colors are advisable. 

the distribution of the data would probably be suitable to a log scale on the y axis. this would separate the bottom of the range, which now appears to be the same by eye for all categories.

the choice of a single color colormap is great: it shows gradients intuitively without suggesting anything else. however the color map has a large gradient between the first and  second color (gray to pink) which is misleading as it separates the locations with this color as different, while the range is 0-2: an interval as any other in the carbon emission scale.

the upper range is not bound. it should be shown somewhere for reference what the true range is

the granularity is not explained. an explanation for it does not necessarily belong in the plot but if this were included in a document it should certainly be explained why some regions are very finely sampled and others are note 

alaska and hawaii are nicely included and separated appropriately but he gray lines (though the polygon around hawaii has a lot of sides that are not necessary separating empty space between HW and AK giving the odd impression that HW is surrounded
