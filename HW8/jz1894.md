CLARITY: It is easy to read the difference of each county, but it will be more clear if the legend and graph in one picture.
         It will be more helpful if put some abbreviation of states' name.
ESTHETIC: It will be easier to read if use cool color like blue.
          It will not be a problem, if a reader is color blind
          Graphical choices are allowing me to focus on the right elements.

HONESTY: The plot is honestly reproducing the data.
